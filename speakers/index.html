  <div class="reveal-headline" data-close>Jon Favreau &ndash; Director, Writer, Actor</div>
  <p>
    Multi-talented director, writer and actor, Jon Favreau continues to challenge himself with a variety of eclectic projects.
    <br>
    Favreau is currently directing the Disney live action feature, The Lion King, hot off the heels of directing his wildly successful The Jungle Book. Before taking on the Disney live action universe, Favreau was seen in the Open Road Films feature, Chef, which he also wrote and directed.
    <br>
    Before that, Favreau directed the Dreamworks/Universal feature, Cowboys & Aliens, starring Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde, and both blockbuster hits Iron Man and Iron Man 2 starring Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow for Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios. He also directed the acclaimed holiday smash hit Elf, starring Will Ferrell for New Line Cinema, as well as Zathura, a children’s adventure film starring Tim Robbins, for Sony Entertainment. He made his feature film directorial debut with Artisan Entertainment’s Made, which he also wrote, and originally established himself as a writer of considerable talent with the acclaimed comedy Swingers.
    <br>
    In addition to his tremendous success on the big screen, Favreau has served as the creator, producer and host of the critically acclaimed and Emmy-nominated IFC series Dinner for Five, and has directed the pilots for the CBS Big Bang Theory spinoff Young Sheldon, the Seth McFarlane FOX sci-fi comedy The Orville.
    <br>
    As an actor, Favreau’s feature film credits include Spider-Man: Homecoming, The Wolf of Wall Street, I Love You, Man, The Break-Up, Something’s Gotta Give, Wimbledon, Daredevil, Rocky Marciano, Love & Sex, The Replacements, Very Bad Things, Deep Impact, and Rudy. Acting for television, his credits include Seinfeld, a recurring role on Friends and a special appearance on HBO’s critically acclaimed The Sopranos, in which he played himself.
    <br>
    Favreau is proud to have helped keep production in Los Angeles, notably on the films Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Chef, Jungle Book, The Lion King, and on the pilot episodes of Young Sheldon and The Orville. Favreau also serves as third Vice President of the Directors Guild of America, and is a board member for the American Cinematheque, a non-profit, cultural organization dedicated to the public presentation of the moving picture in all its forms and the operation of both the Egyptian and Aero theaters in Los Angeles. Another cause important to Favreau has been Tony Hawk’s Stand Up for Skateparks Fundraiser for the past eight years; he was a co-chair in 2013, and in 2014 he served as a member of the Benefit Committee.

  <div class="reveal-headline" data-close>Mark Ronson &ndash; Producer, Songwriter-Musician</div>
  <p>
    Beginning his career as New York’s hottest DJ, Mark Ronson has just produced his fourth album UPTOWN SPECIAL.
    <br>
    UPTOWN SPECIAL - Nelson George, November 2014 Uptown Special, is a tale of several cities, a wide range of collaborators, and a road trip deep into the American South. However, the story of Ronson’s latest project really starts back when he was New York’s hottest DJ. In the late 1990s into the early 2000s the New York club scene was percolating with booming hip-hop and glitzy R&amp;B. In those days before he emerged as a multi-talented musical force, Ronson mannaed the turntables of many great parties. This mix of vintage R&amp;B and pop with contemporary hip-hop is what made Ronson a star DJ. Uptown Special has all the flavor of a night with Mark rocking the ones and twos with funk, soul, and psychedelic pop in a style that echoes classic productions by Quincy Jones and Steely Dan, and funneled through its creators sophisticated understanding of arrangement and melody.
    <br>
    The first single, “Uptown Funk”, features GRAMMY® award-winning superstar Bruno Mars on vocals and drums, who sings with passion and plays drums with fire that will bring funk back on the radio. Though Ronson is now based out of London, most of Uptown Special was recorded in the United States with stops in Los Angeles, Memphis and Mississippi. Most of the music was recorded with live musicians with Mark anchoring the sessions on guitar, while surrounded by a complimentary mix of gifted young players and R&amp;B vets. Several musicians, who worked with Mark on his historic production of Amy Winehouse’s multi-platinum Back To Black and his own breakthrough album, 2007’s Version, rejoined him for this album, including drummer Homer Steinweiss, bassist Nick Movshan and guitarist Tommy Brenneck. Also making guest appearances on ‘Uptown Special’ are bassist Willie Weeks(who played on Stevie Wonder’s classic Innervisions) guitarist Carlos Alomar (who created the familiar guitar riff on David Bowie’s “Fame”) and drummer Steve Jordan (member of the John Mayer Trio).

          <h3>Mark Ronson</h3>
          <p>Beginning his career as New York’s hottest DJ, Mark Ronson has just produced his fourth album UPTOWN SPECIAL.</p>

                  UPTOWN SPECIAL - Nelson George, November 2014 Uptown Special, is a tale of several cities, a wide range of collaborators, and a road trip deep into the American South. However, the story of Ronson’s latest project really starts back when he was New York’s hottest DJ. In the late 1990s into the early 2000s the New York club scene was percolating with booming hip-hop and glitzy R&amp;B. In those days before he emerged as a multi-talented musical force, Ronson mannaed the turntables of many great parties. This mix of vintage R&amp;B and pop with contemporary hip-hop is what made Ronson a star DJ. Uptown Special has all the flavor of a night with Mark rocking the ones and twos with funk, soul, and psychedelic pop in a style that echoes classic productions by Quincy Jones and Steely Dan, and funneled through its creators sophisticated understanding of arrangement and melody.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The first single, “Uptown Funk”, features GRAMMY® award-winning superstar Bruno Mars on vocals and drums, who sings with passion and plays drums with fire that will bring funk back on the radio. Though Ronson is now based out of London, most of Uptown Special was recorded in the United States with stops in Los Angeles, Memphis and Mississippi. Most of the music was recorded with live musicians with Mark anchoring the sessions on guitar, while surrounded by a complimentary mix of gifted young players and R&amp;B vets. Several musicians, who worked with Mark on his historic production of Amy Winehouse’s multi-platinum Back To Black and his own breakthrough album, 2007’s Version, rejoined him for this album, including drummer Homer Steinweiss, bassist Nick Movshan and guitarist Tommy Brenneck. Also making guest appearances on ‘Uptown Special’ are bassist Willie Weeks(who played on Stevie Wonder’s classic Innervisions) guitarist Carlos Alomar (who created the familiar guitar riff on David Bowie’s “Fame”) and drummer Steve Jordan (member of the John Mayer Trio).

                  From eyewitness to history maker, Pete Souza provides behind-the-scenes photographs from the White House and beyond.

                  A decade ago graphic designer and rock drummer Yves Peters started reviewing type in his Bald Condensed column on Typographer.org. In August 2008 he put his graphic design career on the back burner, freeing him to concentrate on his writing and related activities in the digital type business.

After writing for Unzipped, his blog on the FontShop BeNeLux home page, Yves came to notoriety as the editor-in-chief for the international design and typography blog The FontFeed. He is now design writer and producer for Type Network, news editor for Typographics magazine, and assists a number of independent foundries as copywriter and consultant.

Yves tries to be critical about typography without coming across as a snob. His talent for being able to identify most typefaces on sight is utterly useless in daily life.

Nicole A. Phillips from Typograph.Her said of Yves: ‘One of the best contemporary writers on typography, type design & culture because he makes his content accessible and easy to understand.’<br>

These tools, coupled with screen printing, shaped not only his art but his creative process. From working with bands like Arctic Monkeys, Wilco, and Tom Petty, to fortune 500 corporations like Google, IBM, and Nike, Dan has discovered that the most difficult thing he ever had to design was his own career.<br>

Randy Braun began working full-time for DJI in 2014. He served as Director of Product Experience and managed the Still Photography Development Team. In 2017 he co-founded the DJI Aerial Photo Academy, a traveling workshop series teaching drone photography skills across North America.<br>

                  Inspiration came during a close encounter with a humpback whale in her kayak near Maui; an experience that forever changed her life. Since then Stacy Garlington spends much of her time studying the art of photography and creating images using small aerial drones.

Stacy realized the tremendous potential of aerial photography during the early stages of the consumer drone industry. She began to create impactful images using basic camera skills. Her work is now published in both Forbes and TIME magazines -- examples of the new perspective achievable using this technology.

“I never had a formal education, so how did I end up working for the world’s largest drone company with an office in both Silicon Valley and Shenzhen China?

I feel that enjoying photography, Photoshop and Lightroom can get WAY too complicated. So my personal mission (and absolute favorite thing to do), is to create education that simplifies the process of taking great photos, and how to edit them to get the results you’ve always wanted. I’m also very honored to be included as a Sony Artisan of Imagery, a Photoshop Hall of Fame Inductee, and author of over 15 books on photo-editing (Lightroom & Photoshop) and photography.<br>

    <h3 class="speaker-modal-info" data-close>Potter, Designer, and Author</h3>
    <p class="speaker-bio" data-close>Jonathan’s mission: to bring Modern American Glamour to your life. How? By creating a foundation of timelessly chic furniture and accessorizing with abandon.

It all started with pottery. Jonathan first gave the wheel a spin at summer camp when he was 12 years old. He was obsessed with clay the moment he touched it. Unfortunately, his passion wasn’t always encouraged. After his college professor told him, “You have no talent. Move to New York and become a lawyer,” he attempted to comply, moving to the city and working in entertainment biz. Three years later he quit and went back to the wheel.

In 1993, Barneys bought his collection of pots, and five years later, he opened his first store in Soho. Today his offerings span furniture, lighting, home décor, and more, plus countless iconic interior projects, and over 25 stores, all rooted in his commitment to outstanding design, impeccable materials, and unparalleled craftsmanship.</p>

    <h3 class="speaker-modal-info" data-close>Director, Writer and Actor</h3>
    <p class="speaker-bio" data-close>Multi-talented director, writer and actor, Jon Favreau continues to challenge himself with a variety of eclectic projects.
Favreau is currently directing the Disney live action feature, The Lion King, hot off the heels of directing his wildly successful The Jungle Book. Before taking on the Disney live action universe, Favreau was seen in the Open Road Films feature, Chef, which he also wrote and directed.
Before that, Favreau directed the Dreamworks/Universal feature, Cowboys & Aliens, starring Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde, and both blockbuster hits Iron Man and Iron Man 2 starring Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow for Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios. He also directed the acclaimed holiday smash hit Elf, starring Will Ferrell for New Line Cinema, as well as Zathura, a children’s adventure film starring Tim Robbins, for Sony Entertainment. He made his feature film directorial debut with Artisan Entertainment’s Made, which he also wrote, and originally established himself as a writer of considerable talent with the acclaimed comedy Swingers.
In addition to his tremendous success on the big screen, Favreau has served as the creator, producer and host of the critically acclaimed and Emmy-nominated IFC series Dinner for Five, and has directed the pilots for the CBS Big Bang Theory spinoff Young Sheldon, the Seth McFarlane FOX sci-fi comedy The Orville.
As an actor, Favreau’s feature film credits include Spider-Man: Homecoming, The Wolf of Wall Street, I Love You, Man, The Break-Up, Something’s Gotta Give, Wimbledon, Daredevil, Rocky Marciano, Love & Sex, The Replacements, Very Bad Things, Deep Impact, and Rudy. Acting for television, his credits include Seinfeld, a recurring role on Friends and a special appearance on HBO’s critically acclaimed The Sopranos, in which he played himself.
Favreau is proud to have helped keep production in Los Angeles, notably on the films Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Chef, Jungle Book, The Lion King, and on the pilot episodes of Young Sheldon and The Orville. Favreau also serves as third Vice President of the Directors Guild of America, and is a board member for the American Cinematheque, a non-profit, cultural organization dedicated to the public presentation of the moving picture in all its forms and the operation of both the Egyptian and Aero theaters in Los Angeles. Another cause important to Favreau has been Tony Hawk’s Stand Up for Skateparks Fundraiser for the past eight years; he was a co-chair in 2013, and in 2014 he served as a member of the Benefit Committee.</p>

    <h3 class="speaker-modal-info" data-close>Design Writer | Bald Condensed</h3>
    <p class="speaker-bio" data-close>A decade ago graphic designer and rock drummer Yves Peters started reviewing type in his Bald Condensed column on Typographer.org. In August 2008 he put his graphic design career on the back burner, freeing him to concentrate on his writing and related activities in the digital type business.

After writing for Unzipped, his blog on the FontShop BeNeLux home page, Yves came to notoriety as the editor-in-chief for the international design and typography blog The FontFeed. He is now design writer and producer for Type Network, news editor for Typographics magazine, and assists a number of independent foundries as copywriter and consultant.

Yves tries to be critical about typography without coming across as a snob. His talent for being able to identify most typefaces on sight is utterly useless in daily life.

Nicole A. Phillips from Typograph.Her said of Yves: ‘One of the best contemporary writers on typography, type design & culture because he makes his content accessible and easy to understand.’</p>
