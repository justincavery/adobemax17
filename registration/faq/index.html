You must be registered for MAX 2017 in order to take advantage of the negotiated discounted hotel rates, which are on a first-come, first-served basis. Do not contact hotels directly; negotiated rates can be obtained only through the MAX registration process.</li>
  <li>New hotel reservations or changes to existing reservations can be made through the registration portal until September 24, 2017. Beginning September 28th, all reservation changes will need to be made directly with the hotel.</li>

Any unused authorized funds will be released back to you between 3-5 business days after your departure.

              <p>The Scheduler is an online tool available for registered attendees to build your personalized schedule of breakouts. You can access it by signing in on max.adobe.com. Breakouts fill quickly, so schedule as soon as possible. The MAX Scheduler will be available starting in June 2017. Onsite note: Space in breakouts will be limited. If you have pre-registered for a breakout, you must arrive three minutes prior to when a breakout begins to secure your seat. Your enrollment in a breakout will be validated and scanned at the time of entry. Anyone who is not pre-enrolled may be asked to wait in an onsite wait line.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>If a breakout is sold out, you may add yourself to the online waitlist. Two weeks prior to MAX, all waitlists will be cleared to allow wait listed attendees to sign up for another breakout and ensure their seat. If you remain on a waitlist at that time, you will receive an email notification to alert you that the waitlists have been cleared. If you would still like to try to get into the sold out breakout, there will be an onsite wait line outside of the breakout room. We suggest you arrive 15-20 minutes prior to the breakout start time. Two minutes prior to the start of the breakout, if seats are available, the door monitor will allow wait line attendees into the room on a first-come, first served basis as space allows.</p>
<p>Please note: getting added to the online waitlist does not guarantee you a seat in a breakout. In addition, if you have pre-registered and been confirmed for a breakout via the MAX Scheduler, you MUST arrive at least THREE minutes prior to the breakout start time to guarantee your seat. Otherwise, it may be forfeited to those in the onsite wait line.</p>

              <p>To schedule sessions, you will need to log in to the MAX catalog with the username and password you created when you registered for MAX.</p>
<p>Once logged in you can search for sessions by catalog view in the “Browse and Search” tab, applying the various search filters to find what interests you. From there you’ll click on “Scheduling Options” to show the various times the breakout is offered and add one to your schedule.

Log back in to the registration portal and click “purchase registration items” to add a preconference to your schedule, while space is available.</p>

              <p>To delete a session from your schedule, click on “Edit Schedule” and pull up the appropriate date. Find the session you wish to remove on your schedule, and click the “x” in the upper right hand corner of where the session appears in your schedule. You will receive a message asking you to confirm that you would like to delete your session before the change is final. You can also search for the session in the catalog view and delete it from the scheduling options to the right of the session name.</p>
<p>Swapping a session can be done in either view (Schedule vs. Catalog); however, we recommend the schedule view so that you can see where a session would overlap with others on your schedule before you schedule it. To complete the swap, hover over the session listing you’re interested in adding to your schedule. It will show up as a gray overlay in your schedule to the right if you already have a session scheduled that conflicts. Click the session you’re interested in adding. A pop-up will appear asking if you would like to remove the other session in your schedule and replace it with the new one. Please be advised as soon as you make the swap, you will be removed from the previous session.  If it is full with a waitlist, the first person on the waitlist will <em>immediately have the session added to their schedule.</em></p>

              <p>If a breakout is full, you may elect to add yourself to the online waitlist for that session if the waitlist is open.

  <p>If you are not pre-registered for a breakout or you are on the online waitlist, you can stand in the onsite wait line outside of the breakout room.

              <p>Yes. Room assignments are subject to change up until the week before the event.

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>Start times are staggered for a couple of reasons. We find that congestion in the halls is greatly decreased when we do not have sessions and labs starting at the same time because we avoid every attendee moving from one breakout to another at the same time. We also stagger to allow us to have a full schedule. If we did not stagger, we’d have some very long breaks in between some of our start times.</p>
<p>We also try to balance out the schedule so that everyone can still attend the same minimum number of sessions/labs per day, ie: three breakouts Wednesday and four on Thursday, depending on what they choose. We also try to avoid sessions ending at the exact same time labs begin (or vice versa) because then we set people up for failure when it comes to getting to a session or lab by the start and not losing their seat.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>Sessions are lecture/presentation-based breakouts. The only thing an attendee may want to bring is a notebook and pen to take notes if desired. For our computer-provided labs, we provide all of the required equipment and files needed to participate. In limited cases, a speaker may reach out in advance of MAX to recommend that you bring a mobile phone or device to take photos, but those cases are limited and will be communicated in advance. For Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) labs, attendees will learn on their own laptops; therefore, it is required that you bring your laptop and/or mobile device (if applicable) in order to participate. Demo files will be provided to attendees in advance to download onto their laptops. An active Creative Cloud membership is also required to participate.</p>

              <p>We will post presentations and materials the week before MAX for all breakouts for which we are permitted to share such documents. Some of our speakers are bound by copyright or licensing agreements and therefore do not permit us to make their materials available for download. </p>
<p>Materials will be available for download via the MAX Session Catalog. Attendees must be logged in in order to download the documents. </p>

<h5>Group Discount Terms and Conditions:</h5>
<p>This offer cannot be combined with any other offer, package, or promotion codes. You may choose to pay with the same credit card for the multiple registration fees or use individual credit cards for each transaction.

                    <p>The Scheduler is an online tool available for registered attendees to build your personalized schedule of breakouts. You can access it by signing in on max.adobe.com. Breakouts fill quickly, so schedule as soon as possible. The MAX Scheduler will be available starting in June 2017. Onsite note: Space in breakouts will be limited. If you have pre-registered for a breakout, you must arrive three minutes prior to when a breakout begins to secure your seat. Your enrollment in a breakout will be validated and scanned at the time of entry. Anyone who is not pre-enrolled may be asked to wait in an onsite wait line.</p>

                  <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                    <p>If a breakout is sold out, you may add yourself to the online waitlist. Two weeks prior to MAX, all waitlists will be cleared to allow wait listed attendees to sign up for another breakout and ensure their seat. If you remain on a waitlist at that time, you will receive an email notification to alert you that the waitlists have been cleared. If you would still like to try to get into the sold out breakout, there will be an onsite wait line outside of the breakout room. We suggest you arrive 15-20 minutes prior to the breakout start time. Two minutes prior to the start of the breakout, if seats are available, the door monitor will allow wait line attendees into the room on a first-come, first served basis as space allows.</p>
<p>Please note: getting added to the online waitlist does not guarantee you a seat in a breakout. In addition, if you have pre-registered and been confirmed for a breakout via the MAX Scheduler, you MUST arrive at least THREE minutes prior to the breakout start time to guarantee your seat. Otherwise, it may be forfeited to those in the onsite wait line.</p>

Find the session you wish to remove on your schedule, and click the “x” in the upper right hand corner of where the session appears in your schedule.

You can also search for the session in the catalog view and delete it from the scheduling options to the right of the session name.</p>
<p>Swapping a session can be done in either view (Schedule vs. Catalog); however, we recommend the schedule view so that you can see where a session would overlap with others on your schedule before you schedule it. To complete the swap, hover over the session listing you’re interested in adding to your schedule. It will show up as a gray overlay in your schedule to the right if you already have a session scheduled that conflicts. Click the session you’re interested in adding. A pop-up will appear asking if you would like to remove the other session in your schedule and replace it with the new one. Please be advised as soon as you make the swap, you will be removed from the previous session.  If it is full with a waitlist, the first person on the waitlist will <em>immediately have the session added to their schedule.</em></p>

                    <p>No. Please see our onsite wait line policy above.  </p>

                  <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                    <p>We do not have waitlists for preconference sessions that you can add yourself to through the MAX Scheduler; however, if you are interested in signing up for a preconference that is full, you may contact customer service to have your name added to the interest list. Much like our waitlist, if someone should cancel, the first person on the waitlist will be contacted and given the opportunity to purchase the preconference.</p>

                  <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                    <p>Our breakout schedule can change all the way up to the conference. We aim to make our final changes a couple of weeks before the conference; however, sometimes unforeseen circumstances can necessitate a last minute time change or cancelation. </p>

                  <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                    <p>Yes. Room assignments are subject to change up until the week before the event. We highly recommend waiting until the week prior to MAX to identify the rooms in which your breakouts take place. The MAX app will also be a great resource onsite to see where the breakouts are happening.</p>

                  <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                    <p>Start times are staggered for a couple of reasons. We find that congestion in the halls is greatly decreased when we do not have sessions and labs starting at the same time because we avoid every attendee moving from one breakout to another at the same time. We also stagger to allow us to have a full schedule. If we did not stagger, we’d have some very long breaks in between some of our start times.</p>
<p>We also try to balance out the schedule so that everyone can still attend the same minimum number of sessions/labs per day, ie: three breakouts Wednesday and four on Thursday, depending on what they choose. We also try to avoid sessions ending at the exact same time labs begin (or vice versa) because then we set people up for failure when it comes to getting to a session or lab by the start and not losing their seat.</p>

                  <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                    <p>Sessions are lecture/presentation-based breakouts. The only thing an attendee may want to bring is a notebook and pen to take notes if desired. For our computer-provided labs, we provide all of the required equipment and files needed to participate. In limited cases, a speaker may reach out in advance of MAX to recommend that you bring a mobile phone or device to take photos, but those cases are limited and will be communicated in advance. For Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) labs, attendees will learn on their own laptops; therefore, it is required that you bring your laptop and/or mobile device (if applicable) in order to participate. Demo files will be provided to attendees in advance to download onto their laptops. An active Creative Cloud membership is also required to participate.</p>

                    <p>We will post presentations and materials the week before MAX for all breakouts for which we are permitted to share such documents. Some of our speakers are bound by copyright or licensing agreements and therefore do not permit us to make their materials available for download. </p>
<p>Materials will be available for download via the MAX Session Catalog. Attendees must be logged in in order to download the documents. </p>
